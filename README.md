Control your terrarium with a raspberry pi

## Disclaimer
Some source has been written by myself, but a big part of the code and libs used are from other locations.
Where the code is from is documented in the source itself. They may have different licenses.

## Things needed to use/compile
You will need some more sources to use/build everything here. Note that this list will not be cleaned up, so there may be libs here that are not used at all
